Hello. This is my recruitment task for Hapag-Lloyd. For the app to work properly you need to run:
1. npm run start
2. json-server --watch db.json -p 5555

I used React with TypeScript because I'm most proficient with this, also MaterialUI for design.
I planned to use Redux instead of a simple api for storing data but there were some issues, so I used a safer strategy.
The only feature that is missing is searching.
